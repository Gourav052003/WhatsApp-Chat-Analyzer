This is very alarming that four placement drives process going on and students are not registering themselves in placement drives. In orientation, the guidelines were clearly told to register for placement drives in which you are eligible. So, you are advised to register for the same if eligible,  otherwise strict action will be taken as your participation for placement drives is limited. 

Pendency list will be shared by placement team tomorrow 10 am with me so ensure you participate. 

I request all CRs , kindly circulate this message in your respective groups and thumbs up if shared and guide students to register for these companies

In order to promote cultural interchange between the many nations, states, regions, and religions, we have established chapters of National and International students. These chapters were created with the intention of supporting youth programming in artistic and cultural pursuits and fostering a sense of National and Global integration among young people.

 

We've organized chapters and clubs based on states and continents, and each one will host two events at the institution to highlight the diversity of cultures around the world.

 

1.       Art Culture Events

2.       Regional Culture Showcase

3.       Ethnic Culture Event

Greetings from Industrial Design Department

We are pleased to invite you to the Workshop on “Design Principles and Process” by Mr.  Neeraj Kumar (Co-Founder, Crimson Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.) to be organized by the Department of  Industrial Design.

About Workshop: In this engaging and informative activity, students will embark on a journey to master the foundational principles and techniques, design processes that serve as the cornerstone of successful design. From delving into user needs to crafting designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, participants will explore the essential elements of design.

Activity Objective: The goal is to give students the knowledge necessary to develop user-centric products and services within the context of the product design process. Through this immersive activity, students will uncover how to systematically apply these design principles within a structured design methodology. This approach ensures that their creations go beyond mere aesthetics, prioritizing functionality and a user-centric approach.

Activity Outcome:  Upon completion of this workshop, participants will have honed their skills in applying foundational design principles systematically. Their creations will not only be visually appealing but also highly effective and functional and centered around user needs.

Activity Output: Students will be equipped with a powerful skill set, enabling them to craft designs that not only captivate but also deeply resonate with their intended audience. All students will utilize the knowledge and skill set attained by this workshop to explore the design process to be used in various design courses as well as design projects in a more effective manner.

Hoping for active participation of all concerned.

26/10/23, 12:43 pm - Sourabh 7 Mentor: Respected all, 
I extend warm greetings to all of you.

It is my privilege to convey an important message regarding a significant initiative undertaken by our Honorable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi. He aspires to engage one crore participants in the Chandrayaan 3 Maha Quiz, an endeavor aimed at showcasing the remarkable success of India's Chandrayaan-3 mission. On August 29, 2023, Chandrayaan-3 created history by becoming the first spacecraft to successfully land on the Moon's south pole.

To enable people to delve into the details of our nation's lunar mission, MyGov has introduced the Chandrayaan 3 Maha Quiz. Our university implore you to join hands with our nation and be a part of this mission.

In light of this, I kindly request all Heads of Departments (HODs) to make this quiz a mandatory part of the first lecture in each class. The quiz is designed to take only 5 to 10 minutes  of each student's and faculty members. 

Here are some vital instructions:

Registration: To participate in the 'Chandrayaan-3 quiz,' candidates are required to create an individual account at (https://isroquiz.mygov.in). During the account creation process, all participants must provide their UDISE number(U-0747).After registration the quiz will be started.  

Confirmation Count: After completing the registration process, the respective department Administrative Coordinator or any assigned person by the HOD is responsible for submitting the participation count for their department (https://forms.gle/xaUbRbXqjQQY9XyD7).

Awards for the participants include:

1. Cash prizes from the Government of India for the top-performing students.
2. Selection of one student from each state for a visit to ISRO.
3. Upon completion of the quiz, students and faculty members will receive certificates of participation from ISRO and MyGov.
To ensure widespread participation:

1. Participation in the quiz is mandatory for faculty members and students in their second year and beyond.
2. For first-year students, considering their ongoing exams, we kindly request all first-year faculty members to encourage students to spare five minutes for participation.
The deadline for participation is October 26, 2023, at 1:00 PM. The participation counts from each department will be shared at 2:00 PM with higher officially. 

I earnestly request all departments to make mandatory participation  in the Chandrayaan 3 Maha Quiz. This opportunity will enable you to explore the intricacies of our country's lunar mission.

25/11/23, 8:17 pm - +91 74049 72022: I request all my teachers to once look at this problem.

Our cgpa depends upon the relative grading system, in which whole 4th year students are considered. some teachers give very good marks to all which ultimately becomes a problem for those students whose teachers do not award marks easily. <This message was edited>
